<p>Hello World! I am Vibhor Agarwal, currently working as Site Reliability Engineer at Media.net (Directi) in Mumbai, India. I graduated with Computer Science and Engineering (B. Tech.) degree from The LNMIIT, Jaipur in June 2020. My honours include a Bachelor's Best Thesis Award and an overall CGPA of 9.45 out of 10. I was also a Google Summer of Code developer in 2018 and contributed to the open source project, Oppia.</p>

<p>I am mainly interested in Machine Learning and Distributed Systems. I (mostly) code in Python and love to solve real world problems with technical solutions. Besides machine learning, I am also interested in Privacy and Security on the Web, and Computational Social Sciences.</p>
