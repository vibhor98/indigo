* Implemented a sequential Encoder-Decoder Long Short Term Memory Networks based model to translate the input text in German to its corresponding English text.
* Used Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score as an evaluation measure against the reference sentences in the test set.
* The dataset used and implementation can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/vibhor98/Neural-Machine-Translation-using-Keras).
