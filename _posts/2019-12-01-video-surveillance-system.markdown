* This project was my Bachelor's Thesis and also won the Best Bachelor's Thesis Award.
* The project poster was presented at The PyCon US 2020 in Pennsylvania, USA in April 2020.
* Was also a part of India Innovation Challenge Design Contestâ€™ 2018 organised by DST, Govt. of India in collaboration with IIM Bangalore. Our team was selected out of 10146 teams for the contest.
* Aims at pro-actively detecting suspicious activities like molestation against women and automates the current manual Surveillance process to enhance the security standards for women in the society.
* Uses hybrid neural networks containing stacked Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short Term Memory Networks sequentially to capture spatial and temporal information from the live video streams.
* Hardware used is Beaglebone black as a micro-processor along with CCTV cameras to process frames and predict suspicious activities in real-time.
